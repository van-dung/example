More than three years working in this thesis is the most memorial period in my life. It is an honor for me to work and study in a dynamic laboratory, CAIRN in Lannion. 

Firstly, I grateful thank my supervisor Oliver Sentieys, the head of CAIRN, and co-supervisor Baptiste Vrigneau for their consistent supervision and encouragement throughout my study and research, their patient guidance on direction of my work. They gave me breakthrough ideas to improve my works. All of their feedback and suggestions at various stages have been significantly improved my knowledge, scientific minds, and skills of writing and presentation. Besides, I would like to thank Arnaud Carer for his supports in sensor network deployment. 

Secondly, I would like to thank all of my friends in Lannion for their sharing and help. This helps me alleviate homesickness and focus on my work.

My warmest thanks also go to my parents and my younger sister for their never ending support. They always assist me in implementing my desires. 

Finally, I would like to say something special to my wife. She is a powerful emotional support that I can share my burdens and sadness. Thank you for her understanding, her help and her endless love.
