The three year graduate work in IRISA/CAIRN Lab is a most memorial period in my life, not only because I have been led to an exciting field, the MIMO precoding techniques which were totally new to me before, but also I have got the opportunity to study and work in a very dynamic laboratory . 

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Pascal Scalart and co-supervisor Olivier Berder for their consistent supervision and encouragement throughout my study and research, their patient guidance on direction of my work. All of their feedbacks, suggestions, and gentleness at various stages have been significantly improved my knowledges, scientific minds, and skills of writing and presentation. 

I would also like to thank all the members of the jury for reading part of my thesis: Prof. Jean-Pierre CANCES at the University of Limoges, Prof. Dirk SLOCK at the EURECOM (Nice) , Prof. Gilles BUREL at the University of Bretagne Occidentale, and Prof. Jean-Fran?oisand DIOURIS at the University of Nantes. Their suggestions and comments are really appreciated.

I am most grateful to Prof. Oliver Sentieys, the head of CAIRN Lab, for his kind attitude and constant willingness to help makes my graduate study a very enjoyable experience. 

I also want to thank all of my friends in Lannion who make my stay a memorial period. 

My warmest thanks also go to my parents for their never ending support. They always assist me in implementing my desires. 

Finally, I would like to say something special to my girlfriends. She is a powerful emotional support that I can share my burdens, fears and sadness. Thanks you for her understanding, her helps, and her endless love.
